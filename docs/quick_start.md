# Quick start


## HPC setup
---
The setup provided by computer centers are enough for the most common tasks - running, pulling and building[^1].  

[C3SC](https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/miscellaneous/containers/),
[PDC](https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/applications/apptainer/)*[^1],
[HPC2N](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/software/containers/),

[Lunarc](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/software/containers/).

!!! warning "Important"
    > Please setup the following environmental variables that will help you to redirect potentially large files to alternative locations.
    Keep in mind that your `$HOME` folder is relatively small in size. Consider adding the settings in your `~/.bashrc` file.

    ```bash
    export PROJECT=project_folder

    export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/proj/${PROJECT}/nobackup/SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR
    export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/proj/${PROJECT}/nobackup/SINGULARITY_TMPDIR

    export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/proj/${PROJECT}/nobackup/SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR
    export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/proj/${PROJECT}/nobackup/SINGULARITY_TMPDIR

    mkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR $APPTAINER_TMPDIR
    ```


## Local setup
---
This is the preferred setup if you plan to experiment and build containers yourself.


### Apptainer
- [Install from pre-built packages](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/1.3/installation.html#install-from-pre-built-packages)
- [Installation on Windows or Mac](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/1.3/installation.html#installation-on-windows-or-mac)

!!! note
    There is a possibility to [install Apptainer as unprivileged user](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/1.3/installation.html#install-unprivileged-from-pre-built-binaries), providing that the requirements are satisfied.

### Singularity 
- Linux pre-build packages are provided for `.deb` and `.rpm`based distributions [link](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases)
  ``` bash
  # Ubuntu 24.04
  wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v4.3.3/singularity-ce_4.3.3-noble_amd64.deb
  sudo apt install ./singularity-ce_4.3.3-noble_amd64.deb

  # RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux/Rocky 9
  wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v4.3.3/singularity-ce-4.3.3-1.el9.x86_64.rpm
  sudo yum install ./singularity-ce-4.3.3-1.el9.x86_64.rpm
  ```

### Installation on Windows or Mac
[https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/admin-guide/installation.html#installation-on-windows-or-mac](https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/admin-guide/installation.html#installation-on-windows-or-mac){target=_blank}

> (PM) I have successfully installed Singularity under [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10){target=_blank}, but can't guarantee that it will work in all cases.  
> Look at this [page](./vagrant_windows.md) for tips on the typical Windows installation (MacOS is rather similar).
