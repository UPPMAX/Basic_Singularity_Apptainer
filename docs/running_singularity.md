# Running Singularitry container

Let's practice a bit running one of the containers from the previous step.
```bash
$ singularity pull lolcow.sif docker://sylabsio/lolcow
```
This will pull the Docker image in to A singularity container with name `lolcow.sif`.

## Run the Singularity container

Executing the container file itself or a remote build will start will execute the commands defined in the `%runscript` section. This is equivalent to run `singularity run ./lolcow.sif`

```
$ ./lolcow_latest.sif

## Getting a shell in the running container

``` bash
$ singularity shell ./lolcow_latest.sif 
Singularity>
```



---

Let's see what the container gives us.  
Running the container, runs previously defined command - in this case.
```bash
/bin/sh -c date | cowsay | lolcat
```
This uses the container shell, to run three programs that were setup and provided in the container (instead of some heavy calculation tools).

- Try to "play" with these three tools to get the idea how you ca use them while in the container shell.
- Can you check on what OS version the container is build? Run `cat /etc/os-release` "in" the container and "outside" the container.
- If you try to list the files in your home folder with `ls -l ~` you will see the content of your home folder. What about the root folder? List the content with `ls -l /` and compare the output from a different terminal (outside the container shell). 
- Singularity binds the user home folder, `/tmp` and some other by default. If you are running on a computer with more users accounts than your own (like on a computer cluster) compare the content of `ls -l /home` from within the container and outside. You should not be able to see the other users' folders that are on the computer otherwise.

## Execute program in the container
There is of course a way to start a different program than the default shell or the defined in the `%runscript` section.

``` bash
$ singularity exec ./lolcow_latest.sif date
Mon Oct 13 06:46:12 Europe 2025

$ singularity exec  ./lolcow_latest.sif host
FATAL:   "host": executable file not found in $PATH
```

Keep in mind that running in the container you should be able to find the program inside or in the folders you have binded to the container i.e. the system tools and programs remain isolated. 

!!! warning
    If you have setup `conda` or `pip` installations in you profile folder, they get available in the container. This  might conflict with the container setup which is unaware of programs installed in your home folder. To avoid such situations, you might need to run singularity with `--cleanenv` option i.e. `singularity run -e ./lolcow.sif`

## Binding/mounting folders

By default, Singularity binds these folders from the host computer (your computer) to the container defined in `/usr/local/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`.

``` linenums="1"
mount home = yes

mount tmp = yes

#bind path = /etc/singularity/default-nsswitch.conf:/etc/nsswitch.conf
#bind path = /opt
#bind path = /scratch
bind path = /etc/localtime
bind path = /etc/hosts
```

On Rackham few more folders are automatically mounted for almost obvious reasons.
```
- /scratch
- /sw
- /proj
```

Binding folders from the host to the container, allows you to

- "Inject" any host folder as read/write folder in the container  
  frequently used for external databases or standalone tools
- Replace container's folder or file form the host  
  usually used to provide external configuration files to replace default common.
