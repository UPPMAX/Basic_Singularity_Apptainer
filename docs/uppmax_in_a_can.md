# UPPMAX in a can

[https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_in_a_can](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_in_a_can)

This Singularity container will let you run a near-identical UPPMAX environment on your own computer. You will have access to all of the installed software at UPPMAX, all your files and reference data on UPPMAX, but it will be your own computer that does the calculations. You can even use it to analyse data that you only have on your own computer, but using the software and reference data on UPPMAX.

## Typical use cases
- You have sensitive data that is not allowed to leave your computers, but you want to use the programs and references at UPPMAX to do the analysis.
- You have your own server but want to avoid installing all the software yourself.
- The queues at UPPMAX are too long or you have run out of core hours but you want the analysis done yesterday.
- You have your data and compute hours at another SNIC centre, but want to use the software installed at UPPMAX.
## What you get
- Access to your home folder and all project folders.
- Access to all the installed programs at UPPMAX.
- Access to all reference data at UPPMAX.
## What you don't get
- UPPMAX high-performace computers. You will be limited by the computer you are running the container on.
- No slurm access. Everything runs on your computer.
